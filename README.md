# Overview
This project demonstrates a full analysis workflow applied to a multi-country transactional sales data. The objective was to validate, transform, analyze, and interpret revenue, boxes shipped, and average price to create information. Later organized into business insights and strategic recommendations.

# Technical Workflow
* Data validation and structural inspection (Excel & Pandas)
* Data transformation and feature engineering (Pandas)
* SQL-based aggregation and segmentation (SQL)
* KPI development (revenue by country, salesperson, month)
* Performance analysis (country, salesperson, product, month)
* Strategic recommendations
* Analytical limitations assessment

# Skills demonstrated
* Structured data validation and cleaning
* Feature enginnering (datetime info extracted)
* SQL-based aggregation (ORDER BY, GROUP BY)
* Revenue segmentation analysis
* Volume and margin evaluations
* Business-oriented communication
* Reproducible notebook workflow
