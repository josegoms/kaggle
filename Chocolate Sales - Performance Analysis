    "# 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "This analysis uses ranking system to calculate revenue distribution and general performance on different sections.\n",
    "The findings indicate that revenue is well distributed among countries, with the top-performer showing 18.6% share of total revenue, suggesting no overdependency on a single country to carry on the whole operation.\n",
    "The same applies for products, no outlier detected with all products contributing considerably to total revenue. Although the top-performer has a gap of $30 million to the last one, the two highest on revenue summed only incorporate 11% of total revenue. It indicates moderate balance with few adjustements in order to increase specific products participation, no radical interference needed.\n",
    "Sales representative performance present similar result, but with negative outliers. The two top-performers have incredible numbers, but are followed close by their colleagues. Some show rather ability in handling high-end products, and others on large volume. Talents to polish overtime and expect great contributions to the operation."

    "# 6 - Performance Analysis\n",
    "## 6.1 Country Performance\n",
    "**Australia** leads total revenue, representing approximately **18.6%** of overall sales. While it holds a clear first position, revenue distribution across the six countries remains relatively balanced, with no extreme market dependency observed. The **USA** and **UK** follow closely, forming a second performance tier alongside **Canada** and **India**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Zealand** ranks slightly lower; however, the difference between positions is not substantial, reinforcing the diversified nature of the revenue structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing volume (**Boxes Shipped**) alongside average price per box, Australia’s leadership is primarily volume-driven. In contrast, the **USA** maintains competitive revenue despite lower shipment volume due to a higher average price per box. This indicates stronger pricing power or higher-value product mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Canada** presents a growth opportunity: shipment volume is relatively strong, and a moderate increase in average price could significantly improve total revenue without requiring demand expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Salesperson Performance\n",
    "**Kelci Walkden** and **Brien Boise** are the top-performing sales representatives, generating the highest total revenue with minimal difference between them. **Madelene Upcott** follows closely, forming a strong leading group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revenue distribution across the team is generally stable, with moderate gaps between mid-level performers. However, the two lowest-performing representatives display a more pronounced revenue gap, indicating potential performance inefficiencies or territory-related challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Volume analysis shows that Kelci Walkden’s leadership is supported by consistently high shipment numbers. B**everie Moffet** and **Karlen McCaffrey** demonstrate strong volume performance as well, suggesting potential for upward revenue mobility if average pricing improves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, **Madelene Upcott** and **Van Tuxwell** stand out due to higher average price per box, indicating strength in closing higher-margin transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This segmentation suggests two distinct sales strategies within the team:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Volume-driven performers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Margin-driven performers\n",
    "\n",
    "Balancing both approaches may optimize total team revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3 Product Performance\n",
    "**Smooth Silky Salty** and **50% Dark Bites** are the top revenue-generating products, both significantly ahead of the third-ranked product. Together, they account for approximately **11%** of total revenue, which is notable given the overall balanced product distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smooth Silky Salty** achieves its leadership through a combination of high shipment volume and strong average price positioning. In contrast, **50% Dark Bites** relies heavily on volume, maintaining a competitive but more moderate average price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Almond Choco** presents an interesting margin-driven opportunity. Despite lower shipment volume, it has the highest average price per box, indicating premium positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, **Caramel Stuffed Bars** exhibits strong volume but the lowest average price. This product may benefit from price optimization strategies, as even minor pricing adjustments could significantly impact total revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, product performance reflects a mix of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* High-volume core products\n",
    "\n",
    "* Premium niche products\n",
    "\n",
    "* Volume-heavy low-margin items\n",
    "\n",
    "This diversified structure reduces product-level revenue concentration risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.4 Revenue Trends Over Time\n",
    "**January** and **June** generate the highest monthly revenues, followed by **July**. Although these months lead in total revenue, the overall monthly distribution remains relatively balanced without extreme seasonal concentration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revenue peaks in **January** and **June** are primarily volume-driven rather than price-driven, as these months exhibit some of the lowest average prices per box alongside the highest shipment volumes. This suggests demand expansion rather than premium pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**February** and **March** display the highest average prices, while shipment volume is comparatively lower. This indicates potential demand compression during higher pricing periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "While specific seasonal drivers cannot be confirmed without external data, the observed pattern suggests that volume-based growth periods outperform price-based strategies in this dataset."

    "# 8. Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "## 8.1 Optimize Price in High-Volume Markets\n",
    "Canada and other countries have a steady shippment performance. An experiment on prices, such as minor price increases on high-demand products, could increase revenue without requiring sudden physical expansion or demand growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "High volume with moderate pricing suggest a significant revenue expansion potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.2 Leverage Margin-Driven Sales Representatives\n",
    "Sales representatives such as Madelene Upcott and Van Tuxwell show strong performance in higher average price transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "* Assign them premium/luxury lines of products.\n",
    "* Involve them in high-value clients acquisiton strategies.\n",
    "* Watch and replicate their personal strategies across the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "Margin optmization and right talent placement may present stronger profitability than pure volume increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.3 Review Underperforming Sales Positions\n",
    "The lowest-performing sales representatives show noticeable revenue gaps compared to the team average.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "* Provide personal coaching.\n",
    "* Evaluate geographical location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "Improving the table bottom performers can lead to significant revenue effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.4 Evaluate Product Pricing Strategy\n",
    "Products such as Caramel Stuffed Bars show strong volume but low average price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "* Test moderate pricing changes.\n",
    "* New lines maintaning the base flavour but exploring diverse additionals with higher price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "Small margin increases on high-volume products can generate a substantial revenue rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.5 Analyze Seasonal Volume Patterns\n",
    "January and June revenue peaks are driven by shipment volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "* Prepare inventory scaling strategies during peak months.\n",
    "* Launch targeted promotions during historically strong demand periods.\n",
    "* Investigate demand drivers for these months.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "Understading volume peaks and seasonal changes can improve the operation flow and arrangements."

    "# 9. Limitations & Future Improvements\n",
    "## 9.1 Dataset Scope\n",
    "The dataset consists of a single transactional table and does not include cost data, profit margins, or operational expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While revenue performance could be analyzed, profitability and margin efficiency could not be evaluated. Revenue growth does not necessarily reflect profit growth.\n",
    "## 9.2 Learning-Oriented Dataset Structure\n",
    "As the dataset is designed for learning purposes, it presented minimal structural inconsistencies, spelling errors, formatting issues, or null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this alleviated preprocessing steps, it also limited experience with real-world data quality challenges such as inconsistent encoding, missing values, or messy formatting normally found in operational datasets. This suggests that future projects should incorporate more complex or raw datasets to further develop data cleaning mastery.\n",
    "## 9.3 Limited Temporal & Geographic Scope\n",
    "The dataset covers a limited time period and six countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This impacts the ability to perform deeper trend analysis, long-term planning, or regional behaviour studies. Broader time spanning and additional marked would strengthen data-based conclusions.\n",
    "## 9.4 Absence of Customer-Level Data\n",
    "No customer IDs or repeat purchase metrics were available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer retention, segmentation, and lifetime value analysis could not be proceeded.\n",
    "## 9.5 Seasonal Interpretation Constraints\n",
    "Monthly revenue patterns suggest possible seasonal effects; however, no external marketing, economic, or event data were available to empower such hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal interpretations remain observational guesses and could not be consolidated."
